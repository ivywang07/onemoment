		<div>\Step2: User Interveiw
</div>
		<div>And they thought it would be great if...
</div>
		<div>Homepage</div>
		<div>Shows lists created by yourself or copied from others.

		<div>Onemoment
</div>
		<div>A experience-sharing platform to assist you complete life stage tasks.

</div>
		<div>Carried out user interveiw.
Brainstormed to create new features. 
Sketched wireframe and final interface.

</div>
		<div>Find a way to make group chat effectively perfect a list
</div>
		<div>Message</div>
		<div>Inadequate functionalities for list-editing 
</div>
		<div>These two main challenges were put forward by our client. He was considering to make each list as a little community, people who were interested in a specific list would communicate with each other in its little community via group chat. But it was still undecided how to commit group chat to improve list-editing. That’s what we were going to solve. Also the original list-editing was too simple, how to enrich was the other challenge for us. Meanwhile, the client wanted us to make any other improvments to deliver a better user experience.
</div>
		<div>Research
</div>
		<div>\Step1: UX Evaluation
</div>
		<div>Since this was a redesign task, we firstly need to make an evaulation of existing app and see how target users use it, gathering feedback for improvement. Then carry out user interview to better understand their pain points, deriving insights for new features. Thus, we took three steps to conducted the research.</div>
		<div>Ⅰ. List-Editing</div>
		<div>Adding photo is the only option to enrich an entry in the form of non-word.

</div>
		<div>4. Unable to search lists.
</div>
		<div>Works
</div>
		<div>Overview
</div>
		<div>Gourp chats of lists which you created or you are interested in. 
</div>
		<div>\Step3: Usability Test
</div>
		<div>Discover</div>
		<div>There is no hierarchy among tasks.
</div>
		<div>Explore lists created by other users.
</div>
		<div>We asked 6 of participants in last step to do a usability test. We let them explore the app by themselves and recorded their reactions and feedbacks.
</div>
		<div>\Personas</div>
		<div>Synthesis
</div>
		<div>Resume</div>
		<div>1. Able to gain more experience from different people.
</div>
		<div>1. Unlike to join a group chat when having questions about a list.

		<div>2. Allow both to public one’s list or just keep it available to oneself.
</div>
		<div>“Sometimes I can find useful infromation online but it happens that I still have no access to find a anwser of my own questions. Also information online could be unreliable so I won’t trust it until some one or myself validate it.”</div>
		<div>Ⅱ. Discover</div>
		<div>Wireframe for new feature
</div>
		<div>3. Convenient to directly copy others’ lists, save time.
</div>

		<div>List created by user A is copied by user B and posted to the public but there is no difference between these 2 list except users’ name.

</div>
		<div>2. Lack validation for each list.
</div>
		<div>26yr/Yang Professional/Huston</div>
		<div>Kavin Zheng</div>
		<div>We translated unstructured interveiw data into posted-it notes, categorized them according to common patterns among these 15 participants and came up with some potential solutions for problems we already found.
</div>
		<div>Group chats of lists interested in
</div>
		<div>3. Lack alarm function to remind when to do something.
</div>
		<div>“To be honest, I am a procras-tinator. Sometimes I need my friend to remind me what I need do. For applying ssn, I didn’t know what I should do next and my roomate haven’t inform me what he was doing so I left it for several months until I finally completed it .”</div>
		<div>23yr/Graduate Student/Seattle</div>
		<div>About experience on searching information online for a life stage task and completing it, we found that….
</div>
		<div>“I prefer searching online rather than asking friends. I think information online is very helpful. Last time I applied for F1 visa, I had no idea what documents to prepare. I just search on Baidu and there was a post listed all things. I just followed it. Saved my time!”</div>
		<div>About their behavior on interaction online, we found that….
</div>
		<div>Lack search function to allow user seach what they need.
</div>
		<div>Final Design
</div>
		<div>Ⅳ. Messages
</div>
		<div>Hard to extract useful information through  a great deal of conversation

</div>
		<div>Shiyu Yang</div>
		<div>\User Journey Map</div>
		<div>To dig deeper insight about how people may behavior in such a sharing and communicating platform, we conducted the interview around topics of experience on searching informaiton and completing a life stage tasks as well as interaction online.</div>
		<div>System notifications
</div>
		<div>Ⅲ. Messages
</div>
		<div>Group chats of lists created by oneself
</div>
		<div>The creator of one list has no control of its corresponding group chat</div>
		<div>Since this was a redesign task, we firstly need to make an evaulation of existing app and see how target user use it, gathering feedback for improvement. Then carry out user interview to better understand their pain points, deriving insights for new features. Thus, we took three steps to conducted the research.</div>
